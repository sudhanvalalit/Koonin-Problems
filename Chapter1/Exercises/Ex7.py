Exercise 1.7: One of the most important aspects of using a computer as a tool to do physics is knowing when to have confidence that the program is giving the correct answers. In this regard, an essential test is the detailed quantitative comparison of results with what is known analytically soluble situations. Modify the code to use a parabolic potential (in subroutine POT, taking care to heed the instructions given there), for which the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization gives the exact eigenvalues of the Schroedinger equation: a series of equally-spaced energies, with the lowest being one-half of the level spacing above the minimum of the potential. For several values of gamma, compare the numerical results for this case with what you obtain by solving Eq. (1.22) analytically. Are the phase trajectories what you expect?
