"""
Exercise 1.6: The function f(x) = tanh x has a root at x = 0. Write a program to show that
the Newton-Raphson method does not converge for an initial guess of x >~ 1. Can you understand
what's going wrong by considering a graph of tanh x? From the explicit form of (1.14) for
this problem, derive the critical value of the initial guess above which convergence will
not occur. Try to solve the problem using the secant method. What happens for various
initial guesses if you try to find the x = 0 root of tan x using either method?
