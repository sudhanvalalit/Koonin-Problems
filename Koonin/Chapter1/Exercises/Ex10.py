Exercise 1.10: Replace the searches for the inner and outer turning
points by the Newton-Raphson method or the secant method. (When
ILEVEL != 0, the turning points for ILEVEL - 1 are excellent starting
values.) Replace the Simpson's rule quadratare for s by a higher-order
formula [Eqs. (1.13a) or (1.13b)] and observe the improvement.
