Exercise 1.9: Invariance of results under changes in the numerical
algorithms or their parameters can give additional confidence in a calculation. 
Change the tolerances for the turning point and energy searches be done at run-time
or the number of Simpson's rule points (this by choosing menu option 2) 
and observe the effects on the results. Note that because of the way in which 
the expected number of bound states is calculated (see the end of subroutine PARAM) 
this quantity can change if the energy toferance is varied.
