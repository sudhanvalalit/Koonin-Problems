Exercise 1.11: Plot the E_n, of the Lennard-Jones potential as functions
of gamma for gamma running from 20 to 200 and interpret the results. (As with many
other short calculations, you may find it more efficient simply to run the
code and plot the results by hand as you go along, rather than trying to
automate the plotting operation.)
