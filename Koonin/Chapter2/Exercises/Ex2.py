Exercise 2: Apply the Adams-Bashforth two and four step algorithms to the example
defined by eq (2.7) using Euler's method (2.6) to generate the values of y needed to start
the recursion relation. Investigate the accuracy of y(x) for various values of h by 
comparing with the analytical results and by applying the reversibility test described
in Exercise 2.1
